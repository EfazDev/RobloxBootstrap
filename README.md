## Credits
1. Main Coding by <span style="color:#FF8700">@EfazDev</span>
2. Old Death Sound and Cursors were sourced from <span style="color:#FF5FFF">[Bloxstrap files](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap)</span>
3. AvatarEditorMaps were from <span style="color:#FF00FF">[Mielesgames's Map Files](https://github.com/Mielesgames/RobloxAvatarEditorMaps)</span> slightly edited to be usable for the current version of Roblox (as of the time of writing this)
4. Some files were exported from the main macOS Roblox.app files. <span style="color:#FF8700">(Logo was made using the Apple Pages icon, hued and then added the Roblox Logo)</span>
5. macOS App was built using <span style="color:#00AFFF">pyinstaller</span>. You can recreate and deploy using this command: <span style="color:#00AFFF">pyinstaller EfazRobloxBootstrap.spec --distpath Apps --noconfirm && rm -rf build ./Apps/EfazRobloxBootstrap/ && python3 Install.py</span>
